## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require lemaur/cms
```

You can launch the installation:

```bash
php artisan cms:install --force
```

You can publish and run the migrations with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Lemaur\Cms\CmsServiceProvider" --tag="cms-migrations"
php artisan migrate
```

You can use the route with:

Open `routes/web.php` and replace the content with:
```blade
Route::social('social');
Route::cms('cms', '/');
```

You can publish the config file with:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Lemaur\Cms\CmsServiceProvider" --tag="cms-config"

# You also need this 3rd party configuration file.
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\MediaLibrary\MediaLibraryServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

You can publish views with:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Lemaur\Cms\CmsServiceProvider" --tag="cms-views"
```

### Apply a sensible default

Add `domain` to your "config/app.php". I advise you to append it after `asset_url`. 
```php
/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Application URL
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| This URL is used by the console to properly generate URLs when using
| the Artisan command line tool. You should set this to the root of
| your application so that it is used when running Artisan tasks.
|
*/

'url' => env('APP_URL', 'http://localhost'),

'asset_url' => env('ASSET_URL', null),

'domain' => env('APP_DOMAIN', 'localhost'),
```

Change your `.env` file like:
```
APP_DOMAIN=your-website.com
APP_URL=https://${APP_DOMAIN}

CMS_DOMAIN=${APP_DOMAIN}
#NOVA_DOMAIN_NAME=nova.${APP_DOMAIN} # <- this is optional. Uncomment if you use Laravel Nova and use the prefix you like.

...

SESSION_DOMAIN=.${APP_DOMAIN}
```

If you plan to use Laravel Nova, you have to change the `path` on "config/nova.php" file to `'/'` instead of the original value `'/nova'`.
```php
/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Nova Path
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| This is the URI path where Nova will be accessible from. Feel free to
| change this path to anything you like. Note that this URI will not
| affect Nova's internal API routes which aren't exposed to users.
|
*/

'path' => '/',
```

### Increase security

Change values of `encrypt` and `same_site` on your "config/session.php" file.
```bash
'encrypt' => true, // <= automatically encrypt your cookies

...

'same_site' => 'strict', // <= the cookie will not be sent along with requests initiated by third party websites
```

### Need some pages to start with

```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

### Need to generate "Terms of service" and "Privacy Policy"
You can find a good starting point at [getterms.io](https://getterms.io/). They offer T.o.S. for small websites for free.

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
